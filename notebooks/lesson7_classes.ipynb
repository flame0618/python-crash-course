    "# Defining a class\n",
    "- A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes and methods that the objects created from the class will have.\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class. It is created from the class and has the attributes and methods defined in the class. \n",
    "- The __init__ method is a special method that is called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the attributes of the object.\n",
    "- The self parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access the attributes and methods of the class in the __init__ method and other methods.\n",
    "- Attributes are variables that are defined inside a class and can be accessed using the self parameter. They can hold data that is specific to each object created from the class.\n",
    "- self is used to refer to the current instance of the class. It allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class from within the class itself. When you create an object from the class, self refers to that specific object, allowing you to access and modify its attributes and call its methods.\n",
    "- Methods are functions that are defined inside a class and can be called on objects created from the class. They can perform actions on the attributes of the object or return values based on the attributes. \n",
    "- Inheritance is a way to create a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class, called a child class, inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class, called the parent class. The child class can also have its own attributes and methods, or it can override the attributes and methods of the parent class.\n",
    "- Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through inheritance. It allows you to use a common interface for different types of objects, making it easier to write code that can work with different types of objects without needing to know their specific class.\n",
    "- Encapsulation is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and only exposing a public interface. This allows you to protect the internal state of an object and prevent it from being modified directly by outside code. Instead, you can provide methods that allow controlled access to the attributes of the object, ensuring that the object's state remains consistent and valid.\n",
    "- Abstraction is the process of hiding the complex implementation details of a class and exposing only the necessary features to the user. It allows you to create a simplified interface for interacting with an object, while hiding the underlying complexity. This can make it easier for users to understand and use the class without needing to know how it works internally."

    "- Inheritance allows you to define a new class that is a modified version of an existing class. The new class, called a child class, inherits the attributes and methods of the existing class, called the parent class. The child class can also have its own attributes and methods, or it can override the attributes and methods of the parent class. This allows you to create a hierarchy of classes that share common features while still allowing for customization and specialization in the child classes. Inheritance promotes code reusability and helps to organize code in a logical way, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future."

    "# Importing classes\n",
    "- You can import classes from other modules to use them in your code. This allows you to organize your code into separate files and reuse classes across different projects. To import a class, you can use the import statement followed by the name of the module and the class you want to import. For example, if you have a class called Car defined in a module called car.py, you can import it using the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from lesson7_module import Car, ElectricCar # call like Car() or ElectricCar()\n",
    "from lesson7_module import * # import everything call like above ## not recommended\n",
    "import lesson7_module as l7 # import everything and give it an alias so use as l7.Car() instead of Car()\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Once you have imported the class, you can create instances of it and use its attributes and methods in your code. This allows you to take advantage of the functionality provided by the class without having to rewrite it yourself. Importing classes is a fundamental aspect of object-oriented programming in Python and helps to promote code reusability and modularity.\n"
