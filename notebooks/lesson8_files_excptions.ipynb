    "# Lesson 8 Files and Exceptions\n",
    "Chapter 10\n",
    "## Reading and Writing Files\n",
    "- To read a file, you can use the `open()` function to create a file object, and then call the `read()` method to read the contents of the file. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    contents = file.read()\n",
    "    print(contents)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- To write to a file, you can use the `open()` function with the 'w' mode, and then call the `write()` method to write data to the file. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('filename.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "```\n",
    "- You can also use the 'a' mode to append data to an existing file without overwriting it. For example:\n",
    "```pythonwith open('filename.txt', 'a') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('This is an additional line.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Handling Exceptions\n",
    "- Exceptions are errors that occur during the execution of a program. You can handle exceptions using `try` and `except` blocks. For example:\n",
    "```pythontry:\n",
    "    result = 10 / 0  \n",
    "\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"You cannot divide by zero!\")\n",
    "```- You can also catch multiple exceptions by specifying them in a tuple. For example:\n",
    "```pythontry:\n",
    "    value = int(input(\"Enter a number: \")) \n",
    "except (ValueError, TypeError):\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "```- You can use the `else` block to execute code that should run if no exceptions were raised. For example:\n",
    "```pythontry:\n",
    "    value = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(f\"You entered: {value}\")```- Finally, you can use the `finally` block to execute code that should run regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. For example:\n",
    "```pythontry:\n",
    "    value = int(input(\"Enter a number: \"))\n",
    "except ValueError:\n",
    "    print(\"Invalid input! Please enter a valid number.\")\n",
    "finally:    print(\"This will always be executed.\")```       \n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "In this lesson, we covered how to read and write files in Python, as well as how to handle exceptions using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks. These concepts are essential for working with files and managing errors in your Python programs.\n",
