    " It can take some practice to learn how to create good variable names, especially as your programs become more interesting and complicated. As you write more programs and start to read through other people’s code, you’ll get better at coming up with meaningful names.\n",
    "1. Variable names should be short but descriptive. \n",
    "For example, name is better than n, student_name is better than s_n.\n",
    "2. Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they could be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.\n",
    "3. The Python variables at this point should be lowercase. You won’t get errors if you use uppercase letters, but it’s a good idea to avoid using them for now."
