# Python Crash Course 
Hope to made programming click for me after many past attempts about the basics. Hope this is a really excellent book. Aim of this repository is not only a study log of mine but also hopefully serves as a learning material for future readers.

Since I have covered some basics of Python before from A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming, I will skip the things that I already know in the notebooks and srcs.

This repository is a structured Python 3 learning process, built from the book Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes with a focus on:
- Clean code
- Data science foundations
- Reproducible learning

## Structure
- `notebooks/`: Interactive lessons and explanations
- `src/`: Clean Python scripts
- `projects/`: Some small projects 
- Each lesson has both a notebook and a script version

## Lessons
### Lesson 1 Chapter 2
- Variables and data types
- Data types and string operations
### Lesson 2 Chapter 3-4
- List
- loops
### Lesson 3 Chapter 5
- If statements
### Lesson 4 Chapter 6
- Dictionaries
- Nesting: among lists and dictionaries
### Lesson 5 Chapter 7
- Input and while loops
### Lesson 6 Chapter 8
- Functions and modules
### Lesson 7 Chapter 9
- Classes

## Tools
- Python 3
- VS Code
- Jupyter Notebook

## Other resources
-  PEP8 Style Guide for Python Code: https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/ 


This repository is part of my preparation for data science roles.
